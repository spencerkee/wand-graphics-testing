Look to optimize triangle finding function.
Have line thickness depend on length.
Have the different circles described produce different images at 
different times?

The color selection function needs to be scaleable
Add time estimation?
Add options to draw lines/triangles or not.
Possibly switch to GraphicsMagick or another
